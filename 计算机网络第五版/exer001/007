参考答案:
There is obviously no single correct answer here. but the following points seem relevant. The present system has a deal of inertia(checks and balances)built into it. This inertia may serve to keep the legal, economic, and social systems from being turned upside down every time a different party comes to power. Also, many people hold strong opinions on controversial social issues, without really knowing the facts of the matter. Allowing poorly reasoned opinions be to written into law may be undesirable. The potential effects of advertising campaigns by interest groups of one kind or another also have to be considered. Another major issue is security. A lot of people might worry about some 14-year kid hacking the system and falsifying the results.
